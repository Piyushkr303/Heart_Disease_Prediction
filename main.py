        st.write("""Heart disease prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a popular approach in the field of medical research and diagnosis. ANN is a machine learning technique that can learn patterns and relationships within data to make predictions or classifications. In the context of heart disease prediction, an ANN can analyze various features or attributes related to a patient's health and provide insights into the likelihood of developing heart disease.

The dataset you provided consists of several columns or features that can be used for heart disease prediction. Let's discuss each of these features:

1. AGE: This column represents the age of the patient. Age is an essential factor in determining the risk of heart disease, as the incidence of heart-related issues generally increases with age.

2. GENDER: This column indicates the gender of the patient. Gender can play a role in assessing the risk of heart disease, as certain conditions may be more prevalent in males or females.

3. CHEST_PAIN: This column describes the type of chest pain experienced by the patient. Different types of chest pain can be indicative of various heart conditions, and their presence can help in diagnosing potential heart disease.

4. RESTING_BP: This column represents the resting blood pressure of the patient. Elevated blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

5. SERUM_CHOLESTEROL: This column denotes the serum cholesterol levels of the patient. High levels of cholesterol in the blood can contribute to the development of heart disease.

6. TRI_GLYCERIDE: This column represents the triglyceride levels in the patient's blood. Elevated triglyceride levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

7. LDL: This column indicates the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. High levels of LDL cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries, leading to heart disease.

8. HDL: This column represents the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as "good" cholesterol, as it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and can lower the risk of heart disease.

9. FBS: This column denotes the fasting blood sugar levels of the patient. Elevated fasting blood sugar levels can indicate the presence of diabetes, which is a risk factor for heart disease.

10. RESTING_ECG: This column describes the results of the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) test. The ECG can provide information about the electrical activity of the heart and help diagnose certain heart conditions.

11. MAX_HEART_RATE: This column represents the maximum heart rate achieved during exercise. Abnormal heart rate responses can indicate underlying heart problems.

12. ECHO: This column indicates the results of an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound test that provides images of the heart's structure and function. Echocardiograms can assist in diagnosing various heart diseases.

13. TMT: This column represents the results of the Treadmill Test (also known as the Exercise Stress Test), which measures the heart's response to exercise. Abnormalities during the test can indicate potential heart disease.

By utilizing an ANN model, you can train the network using this dataset, with the columns mentioned above as input features, and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The ANN will learn the patterns and relationships between these features and the corresponding outcomes, allowing it to make predictions about heart disease for new, unseen data.

It is important to note that the accuracy and reliability of the predictions generated by the ANN model will depend on the quality and representativeness of the dataset, as well as the appropriate preprocessing and feature engineering techniques applied. Additionally, the model should be validated using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques to ensure its generalizability.""")
